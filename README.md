# Gitlit

_Making GitHub a lifestyle!_

Product of the VioletHacks hackathon from August 10-11th, 2019. Top 10.

### Development and Inspiration
As college students, we utilize Github mostly as a means by which to share projects for classes or in an attempt to finesse a job. However, users that are beginning their Github journey and are not enrolled in classes might find Github to be a little intimidating. Our product, Gitlit, aims to gently introduce new users to Github and creates achievements that they can collect and grow their knowledge of the platform and programming!

### Gitlit's Goal
* Increase GitHub user base
* Empower users to explore features
* Remove barrier to entry
* Promote daily use

### What It Does
* Motivates daily activity on Github via Gitlit extension -- viewable on any GitHub user profile
* Redirects to a "trophy case" in which achievements can be unlocked by using GitHub features
* Displays useful links to coding challenges new users can try
* Badges and awards are provided to incentivize learning

### How It's Built
A python script scrapes information from users profile on Github and collects contribution data which is then displayed on a webpage customized to each user; displaying their stats in a user-friendly way, which was built using HTML and CSS.

### Challenges We Ran Into
* It was our first time creating python scripts that the front-end would interact with
* First time working with GitHub API

### Application
Gitlit has several applications, the first of which being the ability to be used in classrooms where first time users of GitHub can be introduced to its many features in a friendly way. This would be ideal in high school classrooms or lower division CS college courses where students are only just beginning to become familiarized with the terminal and GitHub. 

Gitlit could also be seen a means by which to promote certain coding challenges or brand recognition, as each company could sponsor a badge or achievement. Similarly, events (such as hackathons) could host a badge. Not only is GitHub use gamified, it is also a great way to promote events and organizations.

### What We Learned
* Learned how to scrape websites for data
* Connecting scripts to the front-end
